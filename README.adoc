= CN1JailbreakDetection

A library for https://www.codenameone.com[Codename One] to detect if the device is jailbroken/rooted. 

This cn1lib is a thin wrapper around https://github.com/thii/DTTJailbreakDetection[DDTJailbreakDetection] on iOS
and https://github.com/scottyab/rootbeer[rootbeer] on Android.  Other platforms don't support jailbreak detection.

== License

Apache 2.0

== Platform support

Currently supported on iOS and Android.  `isJailbroken()` just returns `false` elsewhere.

== Installation

Add the CN1JailbreakDetection.cn1lib to your project through Codename One settings.

If you havenâ€™t activated any cn1libs before in your Codename One projects, see https://www.codenameone.com/blog/automatically-install-update-distribute-cn1libs-extensions.html[this tutorial] which explains the process.

== Usage

[source,java]
----
if (JailbreakDetect.isJailbroken()) {
	// device is jailbroken
} else {
	// device is probably not jailbroken.  BUT NOT 100% sure.
}
